My name is Imre Eilertsen, from Trondheim, Norway. I use GitHub **very** extensively to work on adblocker list projects, as well as on translations for open-source projects.

[My main repo where I host the lists that I own](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt), has ≥135 lists for 3 dozen extensions and programs, of which around 85 were made from scratch, the latter of which is the standing world record that I'm aware of. I'm also on very good contributive terms with the teams of all of the Big 3 of adblockers: uBlock Origin, AdGuard, and Adblock Plus; as seemingly the only person in the world to do so simultaneously. However, ABP is the only one among them where I hold an official team position as a paid online freelancer.

My translation career (For the most part English → Norwegian Bokmål; somewhat outdated list) on GitHub is also very solid, and includes in roughly chronological order from earliest to recentmost, [Barcode Scanner](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/pull/878), [DNS66](https://github.com/julian-klode/dns66/pull/201), [PCSX2](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/1850), [Unchecky](https://github.com/Unchecky/unchecky-translate/pull/196), [Tampermonkey](https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey-i18n/pull/54), [App Locale 2](https://github.com/Flo354/XposedAppLocale/pull/12), [Etar](https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar/pull/313), [Android DVB-T Driver](https://github.com/martinmarinov/AndroidDvbDriver/pull/16), [Amaze File Manager](https://github.com/TeamAmaze/AmazeFileManager/pull/1205), [Simple File Manager](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-File-Manager/pull/220), [Auto Updater for Chromium](https://github.com/adolfintel/chromiumUpdater/pull/23), [Locale Emulator](https://github.com/xupefei/Locale-Emulator/pull/485), [MAME](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/3828), [Call Recorder](https://gitlab.com/axet/android-call-recorder/merge_requests/20), [Magisk Manager](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/pull/864), [DS4Windows](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows/pull/718), [NTP Pool](https://github.com/abh/ntppool/pull/169), [DBAD Public License](https://github.com/philsturgeon/dbad/pull/62), [piclone](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/piclone/pull/21), [pishutdown](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/pishutdown/pull/4), [lxplug-volume](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/lxplug-volume/pull/6), [lxpanel](https://github.com/lxde/lxpanel/pull/4), [Mintty](https://github.com/mintty/mintty/pull/908), [pipanel](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/pipanel/pull/9), [rp-prefapps](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/rp-prefapps), [lxplug-network](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/lxplug-network/pull/10), and [lxplug-bluetooth](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/lxplug-bluetooth/pull/8). Outside of GitHub, my greatest translation accomplishments include VLC, Audacity, PaintNET, Voidtools Everything, XNViewMP, PeaZip, ElementIO, Mastodon, and Bitwarden.

On the side, I've worked with a dozen or so wiki projects, Sims 3 gamemods, and continuous chef practicing.

For a newspaper-interview-esque Q&A that probably no one asked for, read on below:

* Favourite food: Microwave chicken, I guess. Fits well on days where the couch feels nice. On days where I feel better, I like me some German-style chicken fricassée, or various chips-and-sauce meals.
* Favourite drink: Coca-Cola Vanilla. With sugar. [On the rocks with ice](https://tv.nrk.no/serie/montreux/1985/FUHA02008984/avspiller). Often the only nutrition I can obtain if I feel ill.
* Favourite TV show: Netflix's <i>Bad Sport</i> was pretty splendid.
* Favourite movie: None. I've got good enough movie memory that I can't just casually rewatch a movie on a dime.
* Favourite videogame genres: Racing and Sims 3. Also likes a bit of Ratchet & Clank.
* Listens to: S-pop (My term for Nordic-origin pop/techno/country), compilated at https://www.deezer.com/playlist/4419236002.
* Love of my life: None. Lost the ability to love in 2020-21.
* Children: None (Voluntarily sterilised).
* Avatar source: An OC for the original Lalaloopsy Nickelodeon cartoon I tried to draw. I'm far from being ArtStation or Pixiv levels of good.
* Work environment: An allround multimedia quasi-workstation PC with Windows 11. MX Blue keyboard, sideheld Evoluent mouse, AOC AGON 1440p 165Hz IPS monitor in portrait mode, 5.1 surround with 3 pairs of USB speakers, a 10Gb Ethernet LAN setup, and 500/500 FttH broadband.

Owing to the hefty amounts of medications I need to keep me somewhat calm in everyday life, incl. lamotrigine, sertraline, quetiapine, and diazepam, my ability to perform physical labour is not much to write home about, and sometimes even making dinners or walking to the supermarkets prove too exhausting to do.
