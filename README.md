My name is Imre Kristoffer Eilertsen, from Trondheim, Norway. I use GitHub **very** extensively to work on adblocker list projects, as well as on translations for open-source projects.

[My main repo where I host the lists that I own](https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt), has ≥135 lists for 3 dozen extensions and programs, of which around 85 were made from scratch, the latter of which is the standing world record that I'm aware of. I'm also on very good contributive terms with the teams of all of the Big 3 of adblockers: uBlock Origin, AdGuard, and Adblock Plus; as seemingly the only person in the world to do so simultaneously. However, ABP is the only one among them where I hold an official team position as a paid online freelancer.

My translation career (For the most part English → Norwegian Bokmål) on GitHub is also very solid, and includes in roughly chronological order from earliest to recentmost, [Barcode Scanner](https://github.com/zxing/zxing/pull/878), [DNS66](https://github.com/julian-klode/dns66/pull/201), [PCSX2](https://github.com/PCSX2/pcsx2/pull/1850), [Unchecky](https://github.com/Unchecky/unchecky-translate/pull/196), [Tampermonkey](https://github.com/Tampermonkey/tampermonkey-i18n/pull/54), [App Locale 2](https://github.com/Flo354/XposedAppLocale/pull/12), [Etar](https://github.com/Etar-Group/Etar-Calendar/pull/313), [Android DVB-T Driver](https://github.com/martinmarinov/AndroidDvbDriver/pull/16), [Amaze File Manager](https://github.com/TeamAmaze/AmazeFileManager/pull/1205), [Simple File Manager](https://github.com/SimpleMobileTools/Simple-File-Manager/pull/220), [Auto Updater for Chromium](https://github.com/adolfintel/chromiumUpdater/pull/23), [Locale Emulator](https://github.com/xupefei/Locale-Emulator/pull/485), [MAME](https://github.com/mamedev/mame/pull/3828), [Call Recorder](https://gitlab.com/axet/android-call-recorder/merge_requests/20), [Magisk Manager](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk/pull/864), [DS4Windows](https://github.com/Ryochan7/DS4Windows/pull/718), [NTP Pool](https://github.com/abh/ntppool/pull/169), [DBAD Public License](https://github.com/philsturgeon/dbad/pull/62), [piclone](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/piclone/pull/21), [pishutdown](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/pishutdown/pull/4), [lxplug-volume](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/lxplug-volume/pull/6), [lxpanel](https://github.com/lxde/lxpanel/pull/4), [Mintty](https://github.com/mintty/mintty/pull/908), [pipanel](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/pipanel/pull/9), [rp-prefapps](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/rp-prefapps), [lxplug-network](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/lxplug-network/pull/10), and [lxplug-bluetooth](https://github.com/raspberrypi-ui/lxplug-bluetooth/pull/8).
